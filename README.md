# SantosGUI

SantosGUI is a desktop application that interfaces with [SantosCloud](https://github.com/santosfamilyfoundation/SantosCloud) in order to analyze videos of intersections and produce traffic safety metrics.

SantosGUI allows users to create projects, upload videos, and configure projects, in order to have intersections of interest analyzed. This GUI makes the appropriate API calls to SantosCloud in order to have videos analyzed, and then displays the results of the analysis to the user.

SantosGUI is currently supported on modern versions of Windows, macOS, and 64-bit Ubuntu.
